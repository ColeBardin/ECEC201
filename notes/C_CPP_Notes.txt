C/C++ Notes

Data types:
int - integer - 2 or 4 bytes
float - floating point - 4 bytes
double - double floating point - 8 bytes
char - character - 1 byte
wchar_t - wide character - 2 bytes
bool - boolean - 1 byte
void - empty - 0 bytes

char test = 'h'
wchar_t test = L'ם' // storing hebrew character since it takes more memory
	//use 'L' to specify to compiler that its a wide char

void indicates absense of data

Type modifiers
4 type modifiers:
	signed
	unsigned
	short
	long
all can apply to:
	int
	double
	char

signed int - 4 bytes - used for integers (equivalent to int)
unsigned int - 4 bytes - can only store positive integers
short - 2 bytes - used for small integers (-32768 to 32767)
unsigned short - 2 bytes - used for small positive ints (0 to 65535)
long - at least 4 bytes - used for long its (equal to long int)
unsigned long - 4 bytes - used for large pos ints or 0 (equal to unsigned long int)
long long - 8 bytes - used for very large ints (equal to long long int)
unsigned long long - 8 bytes - used for bery large pos ints or 0 (equal to unsigned long long int)
long double - 12 bytes - used for large floating point numbers
signed char - 1 byte - used for characters (guaranteed range -127 to 127)
unsigned char - 1 byte - used for chars (range 0 to 255)

Float and Double:
used for decimal and exponential values
// creating float type variables
float num1 = 3.0f;
float num2 = 3.5f;
float num3 = 3E-5f; // 3x10^-5

// creating double type variables
double num4 = 3.0;
double num5 = 3.5;
double num6 = 3E-5; // 3x10^-5

must add 'f' and the end of float values because compilers will assume its a double

float: 4 bytes, 7 decimal digit precision
double: 8 bytes, 15 decimal digit precision

Specify decimal points with setprecision():
...
int main() {
	double a = 3.912348239293;
	float b = 3.912348239293f;

	cout << setprecision(13); // sets to 13 digits

	cout << "Double type numner = " << a << endl;
	cout << "Float type number = " << b << endl;

	return 0;
}

This outputs:
Double Type Number  = 3.912348239293
Float Type Number   = 3.912348270416

Specific precision:
int main() {
	...
	cout << "Double type number = " << setprecision(11) << a << endl;
	cout << "Float type number = " << setprecision(7) << b << endl;

	return 0;
}

Format specifier for exponential numbers:

double ex = 325E25;
double num = 3.25;

cout << scientific << num;
cout << scientific << ex;

additional specifier:
fixed : same as default


Long double:
long double num_ldb = 2.569L
//L so compiler knows its a 'long double'
//no 'long float'

Macros:
piece of code which is given some name
#define directive is used to define a macro

//macro def
#define LIMIT 5
int main() {
	for (int i = 0; i < LIMIT; i++) {
		std::cout<<i<<"\n";
	}
	return 0;
}
LIMIT (macro def) is replaced with 5 (macro expansion) by compiler

Macros with arguments
// macro with parameter
#define AREA(l,w) (l*w)
//(l,w) are params, (l*w) is replacement statement/expansion
int main() {
	int l1 = 10, l2 = 5, area;
	area = AREA(l1, l2);
	std::cout<<"Area of a rectangle is: "<<area;
	return 0;
}

File inclusion in Macros
	type of directive tells compiler to include a file in source code program
	two types:
1. Header file or standard files:
	contain definion of pre-defined funcs like printf() scanf()
	i/o functions are in 'iostream'
	SYNTAX: #include<file_name>;
		#include<iostream>;
2. Userdefined files:
	SYNTAX: #include"filename"
Conditional compilation:
	choose to compile or skip specific portions of program
	ifdef and endif
SYNTAX:
#ifdef macro_name
	statement1;
	statement2;
	statement3;
	...etc
#endif

Constant:
const int var = 5;
keyword, data type, name of variable, initial value

or use #define directive
#define indentifierName value

Storage classes:
describe the features of a var/func
SYNTAX: storage_class var_data_type var_name;

5 storage classes:
1. auto		function block	local	garbage
2. register	function block	local	garbage	
3. extern	whole program	global	zero
4. static	whole program	local	zero
5. mutable	class		local	garbage

Auto: will decide data type for your variable
	auto a = 3.2; // chooses float
	auto b = 32; // chooses int
Extern: var is defined somewhere else not within the same block its used
	using this storage class says we are not defining a new var but just accessing a global var that already exists
	and to use that global value
Static: hold value even after theyre out of scope. local to wherever theyre defined
	or can be global. no new memory allocated every time it is referenced
	define static count = 0; inside counting func so count doesnt have to be global
Register: same as auto except compiler tries to store var in microprocessor if a free register is available
	faster use of register variables during runtime than memory ones
	usually a few var to be stored this way that will be used a LOT
	note: cannot obtain address of register vars using pointers
Mutable: allows for data members in 'const' class/structs to be modified without updating other members
	class Test {
	public:
		int x;
		mutable int y; //allows for change of var y if instance is const
		Test(){x=4;y=10;}
	};
	int main(){
		const Test t1; // constant instance t1 of class Test
		t1.y = 20; // valid since data member 'y' is 'mutable'
		t1.x = 10; // will throw error codes
		return 0;
	}


PRINTING AND SCANNING:
#include <stdio.h>
included in standard in out header
printf();
scanf();

Format specifiers: %
%c	Character
%d	Signed integer
%e	Scientific notation of floats
%E	Scientific notation of floats
%f	Float values
%g	Similar as %e or %E
%G	Similar as %e or %E
%hi	Signed integer (short)
%hu	Unsigned Integer (short)
%i	Unsigned integer
%l	Long Int
%ld	Long Int
%li	Long Int
%lf	Double
%Lf	Long double
%lu	Unsigned int or unsigned long
%lli	Long long
%lld	Long long
%llu	Unsigned long long
%o	Octal representation
%p	Pointer
%s	String
%u	Unsigned int
%x	Hexadecimal representation
%X	Hexadecimal representation
%n	Prints nothing
%zu 	size_t length, can be printed with %d but proper way is to use %zu
%%	Prints % character

print 5 digits of int:
printf("text %5d\n"); // Pads with spaces

to pad with zeroes or other character
printf("text %05d");

printing floats with precision:
printf("foo: %.2\n"); // Shows 2 decimal places

Scanning from keyboard:
int a;
float b;
scanf("%d,%f", &a, &b); // Scanf needs '&' for variables. Only takes address
// & gives memory address to variables passed to scanf





Pointers:
variables that store addresses of other variables
multi byte data type
holds 64 bit address, 8 bytes

Special operators:
& //address of operator (what is the MEMORY ADDRESS of this variable)
* //dereference operator (what is IN memory at the address stored at this pointer)

char foo;
char *foo_ptr; //var that stores add of vars of type char
foo = 5;
foo_ptr = &foo; // address of foo
/* printf:
foo (%d): 5
foo_ptr (%p): 0x7ffe1749af07 // hex address of foo
&foo_ptr (%p): 0x7ffe1749af08 // starting address of foo_ptr
*foo_ptr (%d): 5
*/






Loops:
for (initialization; condition; iterator) {
	// body of for loop
}
initialization is executed first and once, usually variable is delacred and initialized
condition is evaluated next, boolean statement
if condition is true, iterator statement is executed, usualyl changes the value of init variable
again condition is evaluated
continues until condition is false and loop terminates


int n = 5, sum = 0
for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {
	sum += i;
}
cout << "Sum of first {0} natural numbers = {1}", n, sum); << endl;

Loops with mutiple initialization and iterator expressions:
for (int i=0; j=0; i+j<=5; i++; j++) {
	Console.WriteLine("i = {0} and j = {1}", i, j);
}

For loops without initialization and iterator statement:
int i = 1;
for ( ; i<=5; ) {
	Console.WriteLine("C# For Loop: Iteration {0}", i);
	i++;
}
//If no condition, loop will be infinite

While Loops:
while (condition)
{
	//statements
	iterator;
}

Ex:
int main() {
	int i = 1;
	while (i<6) {
		printf("Hello World\n");
		i++;
	}
	return 0;
}


Do...While Loops:

do
{
	//statements
	iterator;
} while (condition);


If/Else statements; nested

if(condition)
{
	//statements to execute if cond is true
}

if(condition)
   statement1;
   statement2;

// Here if the condition is true, if block 
// will consider only statement1 to be inside 
// its block since no {}

If/Else:
if (condition) {
	//execute if cond is true
}
else {
	//execute if cond is false
}


Nested if:
if (cond1)
{
	//execute if cond1 is true
	if (cond2)
	{
		//execute if cond2 is true
	}
}

else-if ladders:
if (condition)
	statement;
else if (condition)
	statement
.
.
else
	statement;

Jump statements: BREAK
int stop = 50;
for (int i = 0; ; i++) {
	printf("Current index is {0}", i);
	if (i == stop) {
		break;
	}
}

CONTINUE
will immediately repeat the loop from beginning for next iteration
ignores all code below continue; statement
int main() {
	// loop from 1 to 10
	for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
 
		// If i is equals to 6,
		// continue to next iteration
		// without printing
		if (i == 6)
            		continue;
 
        	else
            		// otherwise print the value of i
            		printf("%d ", i);
	}
	return 0
}

GOTO
Syntax:
goto label1;
.
.
.
label1:

or

label2
.
.
.
goto label2;

EX:
void printNumbers()
{
	int n = 1;
label:
    	printf("%d ",n);
   	n++;
    	if (n <= 10)
    		goto label;
}

Input and Output Redirection in C++:
freopen() to redirect and existing FILE pointer to another stream
prototype:
FILE * freopen ( const char * filename, const char * mode, FILE * stream );

to write the stdout to a textfile:
freopen  "textfile.txt", "w", stdout);

3 Streams:
istream: stream objects of this type can only perform input operations from stream

ostream: objects can only be used for output operations

iostream: can be used for both input and output operations

All operations are performed from buffer which is linked to the source

To redirect from Stream A to Stream B:
get stream buffer to A and store it somewhere
set stream buffer of A to stream buffer of B
if needed to reset the stream buffer of A to previous stream buffer

ios::rdbuf() can perform 2 operations:
	stream_object.rdbuf(): returns pointer to the stream buffer of stream_object
	stream_object.rdbuf(streambuf*p): sets stream buffer to the object pointed by p

using namespace std;

int main() {
	fstream file;
	file.open("cout.txt", ios::out);
	string line;

	// backup streambuffers of cout
	streambuf* stream_buffer_cout = cout.rdbuf();
	streambuf* stream_buffer_cin = cin.rdbuf();

	// get the streambuffer of the file
	streambuf* stream_buffer_file = file.rdbuf();

	// redirect cout to file
	cout.rdbuf(stream_buffer_file);
	
	cout < "This line written to file << endl;

	// redirect cout back to screen
	cout.rdbuf(stream_buffer_cout);
	cout << "This line is written to screen" << endl;

	file.close();
	return 0;
}

Can be condensed into a single step:
auto cout_buf = cout.rdbuf(file.rdbuf())
// sets cout streambuffer and returns the old streambuffer back to cout_buf



Input and Output statements:
cin and cout
int main() {
	int age;

	cout << "Enter your age:";
	cin >> age;
	count << "\nYour age is: " << age;
	return 0;
}

Unbuffered standard error stream:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	cerr << "An error occured";
	return 0;
}

unbuffered, cannot store message

Buffered standard error stream
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	clog << "An error has occured";
	return 0;
}

Clearing the Input buffer in C/C++:
Properly taking inputs into buffer
for C:
int main() {
	char str[80], ch;
	scanf("%s", str);
	while ((getchar()) != '\n');
	ch = getchar();
	printf("%s\n", str);
	printg("%c", ch);
	return 0;
}

for C++:
using namespace std;
int main() {
	int a;
	char str[80];
		
	cin >> a;
	cin.ignore(numeric_limits<streamsize>::max(),'\n');
	cin.getline(str,80);
	cout << a << endl;
	cout << str << endl;
	
	return 0;
}

Declaration of strings vs chars
Strings are arrays of chars that end with '\0' NULL value
Strings: "use double quots"
Chars: 'A' // use single quotes

SYNTAX: string[20] allocates 20 bytes of memory
	string[] will allocate memory per requirement, may run out of memory if string changes drastically in a large complex program

Special Symbols: [](){},;*=#
[] 	arrays
() 	func calls and parameters
{}	start and end of a block of code containing more than 1 line of executable code
,	separates more than one statements like params
:	invokes somethinc called initialization list
;	statement terminator, indicates end of one local entity
*	creates pointer var
=	used to assign values
#	preprocessor is a macro that transforms program before actual compilation

List in C++ STL:
sequence containers that allow non-contiguous memory allocation
slow transversal but once position is foumd, insertion and deletion are quick
Functions for lists:
front()		returns val of first item
back()		returns val of last itme
push_front(g)	adds 'g' at beginning
push_back(g)	adds 'g' at end
pop_front()	removes first element and reduces the size of list by 1
pop_back()	removes last element and reduces size of list by 1
begin()		returns iterator pointing to first element
end()		returns iterator pointing to last element
typical ... for rbegin(), rend(), cbegin(), cend(), crbegin(), and crend()
empty()		returns if its empty or not
insert()	inserts new element in the list before the element in specified pos
erase()		removes a single element or range from the list
assign()	assigns new elements by replacing current ones and resizes list
remove()	removes all elements from list which are equal to given one
remove_if(cond)	used to remove all the values of list that correspond true to cond
reverse()	reverses list
size()		returns number of elements
resize()	resizes list
sort()		sorts list in increasing order
max_size()	returns max number of elements a list can hold
unique()	removes all duplicate consecutive elements from list
emplace_front()	insert new item in beginning
emplace_back()	insert new element in end
emplace()	extends list by inserting new element at given pos
clear()		remove all elements in list, making size 0
operator=	assigns new contest to the container by replacement
swap()		swap contents of one list with another of same type and size
splice()	transfer elements from one list to another
merge()		merges two sorted lists into one

Pairs C++ STL:
first element is ref 'first'
second is ref 'second'
pairs two vals together which may be different types
can be assigned, copied and compared

SYNTAX: pair(data_type1, data_type2) Pair_name;
pair<int, char> PAIR1;
PAIR1.first = 100;
PAIR1.second = 'g';

OR
pair<int, char> PAIR1(100, 'g');

Different ways to initialize a pair:
pair  g1;         //default
pair  g2(1, 'a');  //initialized,  different data type
pair  g3(1, 10);   //initialized,  same data type
pair  g4(g3);    //copy of g3
g2 = make_pair(1, 'a');
g2 = {1, 'a'}

Maps in C++ STL:
maps are containers with keys and values
no two values can have the same key
like dictionaries from Python

associated functions:
begin(), end(), size(), max_size(), empty(), insert(key,val),
erase(pos), erase(cost g), clear(), count('g'), equal_range(), rend(), rbegin()
find('g'), upper_bound('g'), lower_bound(), operator=, emplace_hint(), value_comp()
key_comp(), operator[], at(), swap()

Initializing Maps:
map<int, int> gquiz1;
Inserting into Maps:
gquiz1.insert(pair<int,int>(1,40));

Sets in C++ STL:
associative containers with each element is unique
same appropriate associative functions as other containers
initialize empty set container:
set<int, greater<int>> s1;
s1.insert(10);

printing an entire set/container with iterators:
set<int, greater<int>>::iterator itr;
for (itr = s1.begin(); itr !=s1.end(); itr++)
	{cout<<*itr<<" ";}
cout<<endl;

Unordered Sets in C++ STL:
unordered_set<string> stringSet;
stringSet.insert("code");

Multisets in C++ STL:
can have same valued items
multiset<int, greater<int>> gquiz1;
gquiz.insert(40);


Dynamic Deallowcating and Reallocating memory:
pointer-variable = new data-type;

// Combine declaration of pointer 
// and their assignment
int *p = new int; 

Initialize with new data:
int *p = new int(25);
float *q = new float(75.25);

Allowcating a block of memory
int *p = new int[10]

Dynamically allocated arrays, even local ones, are never deallocated


Not enough memory during runtime?
int *p = new(nothrow) int;
if (!p)
{
   cout << "Memory allocation failed\n";
}

Manually deallocating memory:
delete pointer-variable;

delete p;
delete q;

for an array:
delete[] p;


Pointers and Arrays:

Declare arrays:
by size: int arr1[10]

by size and initialize:
int arr[6] = { 10, 20, 30, 40 }

by user specified size:
int arr[n];

Accessing array elements:
arr1[0] is first element
indexing

int *ptr;
int arr[5];

C:
// C program to demonstrate that
// array elements are stored
// contiguous locations
 
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    // an array of 10 integers. 
    // If arr[0] is stored at
    // address x, then arr[1] is
    // stored at x + sizeof(int)
    // arr[2] is stored at x +
    // sizeof(int) + sizeof(int)
    // and so on.
    int arr[5], i;
 
    printf("Size of integer in this compiler is %lu\n",
           sizeof(int));
 
    for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        // The use of '&' before a variable name, yields
        // address of variable.
        printf("Address arr[%d] is %p\n", i, &arr[i]);
 
    return 0;
}

C++:
// C++ program to demonstrate that array elements
// are stored contiguous locations
 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
    // an array of 10 integers. 
    // If arr[0] is stored at
    // address x, then arr[1] is
    // stored at x + sizeof(int)
    // arr[2] is stored at x +
    // sizeof(int) + sizeof(int)
    // and so on.
    int arr[5], i;
 
    cout << "Size of integer in this compiler is "
         << sizeof(int) << "\n";
 
    for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        // The use of '&' before a variable name, yields
        // address of variable.
        cout << "Address arr[" << i << "] is " << &arr[i]
             << "\n";
 
    return 0;
}

Traversing Arrays:
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
    int arr[6]={11,12,13,14,15,16};
    // Way -1
    for(int i=0;i<6;i++)
        cout<<arr[i]<<" ";
   
  cout<<endl;
      // Way 2
    cout<<"By Other Method:"<<endl;
    for(int i=0;i<6;i++)  
        cout<<i[arr]<<" ";
   
    cout<<endl;
 
    return 0;
}

Initializing Multi-dimensional Arrays:
int x[3][4] = {{0,1,2,3}, {4,5,6,7}, {8,9,10,11}};

//store the address of the first element of arr in ptr:
ptr = arr;
// also equal to ptr = &arr[0];

If ptr is the first element, ptr + 1 is the second:
ptr + 1 is equivalent to &arr[1];
ptr + 2 is equivalent to &arr[2];
ptr + 3 is equivalent to &arr[3];
ptr + 4 is equivalent to &arr[4];

or
// use dereference operator
*ptr == arr[0];
*(ptr + 1) is equivalent to arr[1];
*(ptr + 2) is equivalent to arr[2];
*(ptr + 3) is equivalent to arr[3];
*(ptr + 4) is equivalent to arr[4];

if ptr = &arr[2]; then
ptr - 2 is equivalent to &arr[0];
ptr - 1 is equivalent to &arr[1]; 
ptr + 1 is equivalent to &arr[3];
ptr + 2 is equivalent to &arr[4];

Returning address of pointer: Use &
printf("%p", &x);

Asterisk *: used to declare a pointer before name
or to access the stored value in the address. Dereferencing.

int main() {
	// A normal integer variable
    int Var = 10;
 
    // A pointer variable that holds address of var.
    int *ptr = &Var;
 
    // This line prints value at address stored in ptr.
    // Value stored is value of variable "var"
    cout << "Value of Var = "<< *ptr << endl;
 
    // The output of this line may be different in different
    // runs even on same machine.
    cout << "Address of Var = " <<  ptr << endl;
 
    // We can also use ptr as lvalue (Left hand
    // side of assignment)
    *ptr = 20; // Value at address is now 20
 
    // This prints 20
    cout << "After doing *ptr = 20, *ptr is "<< *ptr << endl;
 
    return 0;
}

OUTPUTS : 
Value of Var = 10
Address of Var = 0x7fffa057dd4
After doing *ptr = 20, *ptr is 20

Pointer Expressions and Pointer Arithmetic:
incremented (++)
decremented (--)
and integer may be added to pointed (+ or +=)
and integer may be subtracted from pointed (- or -=)

meaningless unless performed on an array
adding addresses: meaningless
subtracting addresses: computes offset between two addresses

int main() {
	int v[3] = {10, 100, 200};
	int *ptr;
	ptr = v
	for (int i = 0, i < 3, i++); {
	printf("Value of *ptr = %d\n");
	printg("Value of ptr = %p\n\n");
	ptr++;
	}
}

Output:
Output:Value of *ptr = 10
Value of ptr = 0x7ffcae30c710

Value of *ptr = 100
Value of ptr = 0x7ffcae30c714

Value of *ptr = 200
Value of ptr = 0x7ffcae30c718

Array names as pointers:
with array named val: val and &val[0] can be used interchamgeably

Pointers in multimimensional arrays
In general: nums[i][j] = *(*(nums+i)+j)


Opaque Pointer:
pointer that points to a container whose contents are not exposed at the time of its def
ex:
struct STest* pSTest;

it is safe to assign NULL to an opaque pointer:
pSTest = NULL;

Functions:
user defined:

returnType functionName (para1, para2,...) {
	//function  body
}

void greet() {
	cout << "Hello world";
}

int main() {
	greet();
	return 0;
}

Parameters:
void printNUm(int num) {
	cout << num;
}

int main() {

	double num2 = 5.5;
	
	displayNum(num1, num2);

Return type:
// 'int' instead of 'void' bc it returns an int instead of not returning anything
int add (int a, int b) {
	return (a+b);
}

Classes:
template <class T>
class className {
	private:
		T var;
...
	public:

T is a template argument
class is a keyword
var is a member variable
functionName is a member function
	both of type T

Creating a class template object

className<dataType> classObject;
ex.
className<int> classObject;

C++ class templates

// class template
template <class T>
class Number {
	private:
	//variable of type T
	T num;

template <class T>
class Calculator {
	private:
		T num1, num2;
	public:
		Calculator( T n1, T n2) {

	// create object with int double and bool types
	ClassTemplate<double, char, bool> obj2(8.8, 'a', false);
	cout << "\obj2 values: " << endl;
	obj2.printVar();
	
	return 0;

std::string class in C++
not prone to array decay
strings are slower but offer built in functions

Operations on strings:
getline()	used to store a stream of chars as entered by the user
push_back()	used to input a char at the end of a string
pop_back()	C++11^ used to delete the last character from a string

using namespace std;
int main() {
	string str;
	getline(cin,str)
	
	cout << "The initial string is : ";
	cout << str << endl;
	
	str.push_back('s');
	// puts 's' at end of string str

	str.pop_back();
	// deletes last character of string str

	return 0;
}

Capacity Functions
capacity()	returns the capacity allocated to the string which can be >= size of string
resize()	changes the size of the string
length()	finds length of string
shrink_to_fit()	decreases capacity of string, useful to save memory

using namespace std;

int main() {
	string str = geeksforgeeks is for geeks";
	
	cout << str << endl;
	// initial string

	str.resize(13);
	// resize string

	cout << str.capacity() << endl;
	// string capacity

	cout << str.length() << endl;
	// show new length

	str.shrink_to_fit();
	cout << str.capacity() << endl;
	//show new capacity

	return 0;
}

Iterator functions:
begin()		returns an iterator to beginning of the string
end()		returns iterator to end of string
rbegin()	returns a reverse iterator pointing at end of str
rend()		returns reverse iterator pointing at beginning of str

using namespace std;
int main() {
	string str = "geeksforgeeks"
	std::string::iterator it;
	std::string:reverse_iterator: it1;

	cout << "String using forward iterators is : ";
	for (it=str.begin(); it!=str.end(); it++)
	cout << *it;
	cout << endl;

	cout << "String using reverse iterators is : "
	for (it1.str.rbegin(); it!=,str.rend; it1++)
	cout << *it1;
	cout << endl;
	
	return 0;
}


copy("char array", len, pos)	copies the substring in the target character array, needs all 3 arguments
swap()				swaps one string with another

Raw string literals:
\n
\t
\"
\'
are not processed


stringstream in C++

clear()		clear stream
str()		to get and set string object whose content is present in stream

operator << - add a string to the stringstream object
operator >> read something from the stringstream object

including namespace std;

int countWords(string str)
{
	// breaking inout into word using string stream
	stringstream s(str); // used for breaking words
	string word; // to store individual words
	
	int count = 0;
	while (s >> word)
		count++;
	return count;
}

int main()
{
	string = "geeks for geeks geeks"
		"contribution placements";
	cout << "Numbers of words are: " << countWords(s);
	return 0;
}

Frequencies of words in a string:
using namespace std;

void printFrequency(string st) {
	//each word makked to its frequency
	map<string, int> FW;
	string Word;
	
	while (ss >> Word)
	FW[Word]++;
	
	map<string, int>::iterator m;
	for (m = FW.begin(); m!=FW.end(), m++)
		cout << m->first << " ->"
			<< m->secomd << "\n";
}
int main() {
	string s = "Geeks for Geeks Ide"
	printFrequency(s);
	return 0;
}


Default Arguments in C++:
int sum(int x, int y, int z=0, int w=0){
	return (x+y+z+w)
}


Inline Functions:

inline return-type function-name(param){
	//function body
}

Compiler can ignore the request for inlining and may not perform it:
1. function contains a loop
2. contains static variables
3. function is recursive
4. function return type is other than void and return statement doesnt exist in function body
5. function contains switch or goto statement

Inline function advantages:
1. function call overhead doesn't occur
2. it also savles the overhead of push/pop variables on the stack when the function is called
3. it also saves overhead of a return all from a function
4. compiler can do content specific optimization on the body of function
5. useful for embedded systems for small functions

Inline function disadvantages:
1. variables consume additional registers. can cause overhead if variable size increases drastically
2. using too many inline functions increases size of binary executable file
3. reduces instruction cache hit rate, reducing instructing fetch
4. may increase compile time overhead
5. may not be useful for embedded  systems because size matters
6. might cause thrashing

inline int cube(int s) {
	return s*s*s;
}

Inline function and classes:
class S
{
public:
	inline in square(int s) // redundant use of inline
	{
		// this function is automatically inline
		// function of body
	}
};

Bad writing above
better below
class S
{
public:	
	int square(int s); //declare the function
};
inline int S::square(int s) // use inline prefix
{
}


Example of this concept:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class operation
{
    int a,b,add,sub,mul;
    float div;
public:
    void get();
    void sum();
    void difference();
    void product();
    void division();
};
inline void operation :: get()
{
    cout << "Enter first value:";
    cin >> a;
    cout << "Enter second value:";
    cin >> b;
}
  
inline void operation :: sum()
{
    add = a+b;
    cout << "Addition of two numbers: " << a+b << "\n";
}
  
inline void operation :: difference()
{
    sub = a-b;
    cout << "Difference of two numbers: " << a-b << "\n";
}
  
inline void operation :: product()
{
    mul = a*b;
    cout << "Product of two numbers: " << a*b << "\n";
}
  
inline void operation ::division()
{
    div=a/b;
    cout<<"Division of two numbers: "<<a/b<<"\n" ;
}
  
int main()
{
    cout << "Program using inline function\n";
    operation s;
    s.get();
    s.sum();
    s.difference();
    s.product();
    s.division();
    return 0;
}


Returning in void functions:
void functions can return nothing:
void fun(){
	// body
	return; // good practice to have return statement to ease readability
}


Or void functions can return other void functions:
void work(){
	cout << "The void function has returned a void() !!! \n";
}
void test() {
	return work();
}

int main() {
	test();
	return 0;
}

Returning a void value:
void test() {
	cout <<  "Hello";
	return (void)"Doesn't Print";
}
int main() {
	test();
	return 0;
}


Functors in C++ (Function object)
not functions
need a lot more info to pass through a function than is allowed by params
good practice is to avoid the use global variables

instead: Functors
objects can be treated like a function or function pointer
used along with STLs

to make functor, create an object that overloads the operator()
MyFunctor(10); is the same as MyFunctor.operator()(10);

// A Functor
class increment
{
private:
    int num;
public:
    increment(int n) : num(n) {  }
  
    // This operator overloading enables calling
    // operator function () on objects of increment
    int operator () (int arr_num) const {
        return num + arr_num;
    }
};
  
// Driver code
int main()
{
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);
    int to_add = 5;
  
    transform(arr, arr+n, arr, increment(to_add));
  
    for (int i=0; i<n; i++)
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
}

The line,
transform(arr, arr+n, arr, increment(to_add));

is the same as writing below two lines,
// Creating object of increment
increment obj(to_add); 

// Calling () on object
transform(arr, arr+n, arr, obj);


References in C++
when a varible is declared as a reference, it becomes an alt name for another var

can be delcared as a ref by putting & in declaration

int main() {
	int x = 10;
	
	// ref is a reference to x
	int& ref = x;
	
	// value of x is now changed to 20
	ref = 20;
	cout << "x = " << x << endl;
	
	// value of x is now changed to 30
	x = 30;
	cout << "ref = " << ref << endl;

	return 0;
}
Outputs:
 x = 20
ref = 30

Applications of refs:
1. Modify passed parameters in a function
void swap (int& first, int& second) {
	int temp = first;
	first = second;
	second = first;
}
int main() {
	int a=2, b=3;
	swap(a,b);
	cout << a << " " << b;
	return 0;
}

2. Avoiding a copy of large structures
struct Student {
	string name;
	string address;
	int rollNo;
}
		// if no &, a new copy of the student is created and is inefficient
void print(const Student &s) {
	cout << s.name << " " << s.address << s.rollNo;
}

3. In FOR EACH loops to modify all objects:
int main() {
	vector<int> vect{10,20,30,40};
	
	//modify elements with refs
	for (int &x : vect)
		x = x+5

	//printing elements
	for (int x : vect)
		count << x << " ";
	return 0;
}

4. FOR EACH loops to avoid the copy of objects:
int main() {
	vector<string> vect{"string 1", "string 2", "string 3"};

	// avoid copy of whole string obj by using ref
	for (const auto &x : vect)
		cout << x << endl;
	return 0;
}

Refs vs Pointers:
differences:
1. Pointer can be declared as void but ref is never void
	int a = 10;
	void* aa = &a;. //it is valid
	void &ar = a; // it is not valid
2. Pointer has n-levels/multipel levels of indirection while refs have 1
3. Ref variable cannot be updated
4. Ref variable is an internal pointed
5. Declaration of ref is preceded with & but not read as 'address of...'

int main() {
    int i=10; //simple or ordinary variable.
    int *p=&i; //single pointer
    int **pt=&p; //double pointer
    int ***ptr=&pt; //triple pointer
    // All the above pointers differ in the value they store or point to.
    cout << "i=" << i << "\t" << "p=" << p << "\t" 
         << "pt=" << pt << "\t" << "ptr=" << ptr << "\n";
    int a=5; //simple or ordinary variable 
    int &S=a; 
    int &S0=S;
    int &S1=S0;
    cout << "a=" << a << "\t" << "S=" << S << "\t" 
         << "S0=" << S0 << "\t" << "S1=" << S1 << "\n";
    // All the above references do not differ in their values 
    // as they all refer to the same variable.
 }

References are less powerful that pointers
1. once ref is created, it cannot be made to ref another var later, unlike pointers
2. Ref cannot be NULL, pointers can be to say theyre not pointing to something valid
3. ref must be initialized when delcared, no restriction with pointers

References are safer and easier to use:
1. Safer: refs usually always refer to something valid bc they have to be initialized
2. Easier to use: refs can be used like normal vars. & is only used to initialize. to access members of ref obj, use '.' unlike '->' with pointers

'this' Pointer in C++
passed as hidden argument to all nonstatic member function calls, local variable
not available with static member functions since they cant be called without any object

for class X, pointer type is 'X*'
if member function of X is declared as const pointer type is 'const X*'

C++ lets objects destroy themselves by:
delete this;

Uses of 'this' pointer:
1. When local variables name is same as members name:
class Test
{
private:
	int x;
public:
	void setX (int x) {
	// the 'this' pointer is used to retrieve the objects hidden by local variable 'x'
	this->x = x;
}
	void print() { cout<< "x = " << x << endl; }
};
int main() {
	Test obj;
	int x = 20;
	obj.setX(x);
	obj.print();
	return 0;
}

2. To return reference to the calling object:
/* reference to the calling object can be returned */
Test& Test::func () {
	// some processing
	return *this;
}
//when a ref to a local obj is returned, the ref can be used to chain func
// calls to a single obj
class Test {
private:
	int x;
	int y;
public:
	Test(int x = 0, int y = 0) { this->x = x; this->y = y;}
	Test &setX(int a) {x = a; return *this;}
	Test &setY(int b) {y = b; return *this;}
	void print() { cout<< "x = " << x << " y = " << y << endl;
};
int main() {
	Test obj1(5,5);
	//chained function calls. all calls modify the same obj
	// as the same obj is returned by ref
	obj1.setX(10).setY(20);

	obj1.print();
	return 0;
}

Smart pointers in C++11
automatically deallocates memory when pointer is destroyed

class SmartPtr {
	int* ptr; //actual pointer
public:
	explicit SmartPtr(int* p = NULL) { ptr = p; }
	
	//destructor
	~SmartPtr() {delete (ptr); }
	
	//overloading dereferencing operator
	int& operator*() { return *ptr; }
};
int main() {
	SmartPtr ptr(new int());
	*ptr = 20
	cout << *ptr;
	// dont need to delete ptr bc when obj goes out of scope
	// destructor automatically deletes it
	return 0;
}
this only works for int
instead use Template for all other uses since it can be any type

template <class T>
class SmartPtr {
	T* ptr; //actual pointer
public:
	//constructor
	explicit SmartPtr(T* p = NULL) {ptr=p;}
	
	/destructor
	~SmartPtr() {delete(ptr);}
	
	//overloading dereference operator
	T& operator*() {return *ptr;}

	// overloading arrow operator so that T members can be accessed
	// like a pointer. useful if T represents a calss or struct or union type
	T* operator->() { return ptr; }
};
int main() {
	SmartPtr<int> ptr(new int());
	*ptr = 20
	cout<< *ptr;
	return 0;
}

Types of Smart Pointers:
1. unique_ptr
stores 1 pointer only
int main(){
 
    unique_ptr<Rectangle> P1(new Rectangle(10, 5));
    cout << P1->area() << endl; // This'll print 50
 
    // unique_ptr<Rectangle> P2(P1);
    unique_ptr<Rectangle> P2;
    P2 = move(P1);
 
    // This'll print 50
    cout << P2->area() << endl;
 
    // cout<<P1->area()<<endl;
    return 0;
}

2. shared_ptr
more than one pointer can reference the same object at a time
maintains reference counter using use_count() method
int main()
{
 
    shared_ptr<Rectangle> P1(new Rectangle(10, 5));
    // This'll print 50
    cout << P1->area() << endl;
 
    shared_ptr<Rectangle> P2;
    P2 = P1;
 
    // This'll print 50
    cout << P2->area() << endl;
 
    // This'll now not give an error,
    cout << P1->area() << endl;
 
    // This'll also print 50 now
    // This'll print 2 as Reference Counter is 2
    cout << P1.use_count() << endl;
    return 0;
}

3. weak_ptr
similar to shared_ptr except it does not maintain reference counter


Pointers vs Refs
// A pointer to variable i (or stores
// address of i)
int *ptr = &i; 

// A reference (or alias) for i.
int &ref = i; 

Initialization:
Pointer
int a = 10;
int *p = &a;
	or 
	int *p;
	p = $a; //can be done in 1 line or 2 because ptrs can be NULL

Reference
int a = 10;
int &p=a; //must do in one line

Reassignment:
Pointer
int *p;
p = &a;
p = &b;

Reference:
cannot be reassigned, must be assigned at initialization
however,
int &q = p //is valid

Memory Address:
pointer has its own memory address and size
ref shares memory and address with original var

NULL Value:
pointers can be NULL directly when refs cannot

Indirection:
pointers to pointers, offering levels of indirection
refs only offer one level of indirection

int a = 10;
int *p;
int **q; // is valid
p = &a;
q = &p;

int &p = a;
int &&q = p; // is invalid and will throw error

Arithmetic Operations:
only for pointers
can do arithmetic on address of obj pointed by a ref:
&obj + 5

Use REFS:
	in function parameters and return types
Use POINTERS:
	for pointer arithmetic or passing NULL
	implement data structures like linked list tree




Object Oriented Programming in C++:
class person {
	char name[20];
	int id;
public:
	void getdetails(){}
};
int main() {
	person p1; //p1 is an object
}

Encapsulation:
	wrapping of info and data under a single unit
in OOP: binding together data and the functions that manipulate them
in other words: Classes

Abstraction:
	displaying only essential info and hiding the details

Polymorphism:
	ability of data/message to be displayed in more than 1 form
	implemented by: 
	operator overloading
	function overloading

Inheritance: 
	capability of a clas to derive properties and characteristics from another class
	Sub Class: class that inherits properis from another is sub class or derived class
	Super Class: class whose properties are inhereited by another is super class or base class
	Reusability: Deriving a new class from an existing one by reusing fields and methods

Dynamic Binding: 
	code to be executed in response to function call is decided at runtime

Message Passing:
	message for an object is a request for execution of a procedure
	and will invoke a function in the receiving object that generates result.
	involves specifying name of obj and name of func and info

class ClassName {
access specifier: //private, public or protected
data members: //variables to be used
member functions(){}: // methods to access data members
}; // class name ends with a semicolon

int main() {
	// delcare an object of class
	ClassName ObjectName;
	
	// accessing data member
	ObjectName.ClassVar = Val
	
	// accessing member function
	ObjectName.FunctionName(Params);

	return 0;
}

Inside vs Outside class function definition:
Outside: needs to use scope resolution :: operator along with class name and function name
class ClassName(){
	void FunctionName1() {
		// body of inside function
	}
.
.
.
};
void ClassName::FunctionName2() {
	//body of outside function
} // note no semicolon
int main() {
.
.
.
}

Constructors
special class member which are called by the compiler every time obj of class is instantiated
have same name as class and may be defined inside or outside of class def
3 types of constructors:
1. Default constructors
2. Parameterized constructors
3. Copy constructors

class Cars {
	public:
	int id;

	//default constructor
	Cars(){
		cout << "Default Constructor Called" << endl;
		id=-1;
	}
	//parameterized constructor
	Cars(int x) {
		cout << "Parameterized constructor called" << endl;
		id = x;
	}
};

int main() {
	Cars obj1; // will initialize with id = -1
	Cars obj2(21); // will initialize with id=21
	return 0;
}

Destructor:
	Called by compiler when scope of object ends
class Cars {
	public:
	int id;
	
	// def for deconstructor
	~Cars(){
		cout << "Deconstructor has ben called for" << id << endl;
	}
};
int main() {
	Cars obj1;
	int i = 0
	while(i<5){
		Cars obj2;
		obj2.id = i;
		i++;
	} // scope for obj2 ends here
	return 0;
} //scope for obj1 ends here


Inheritance in C++:
ex. for classes Bus, Truck and Car,
methods fuelAmount(), capacity(), and applyBrakes() will be same
without inheritance, these three methods will have to be written seperately for each class
gives duplicate code

Solution: make Super class: Vehicles and inherit down methods

Syntax: class SubclassName : AccessMode BaseClassName {
	//body of subclass
};

ex.
class Parent {
	public:
		int id_p;
};
class Child : public Parent {
	public:
		int id_c;
};
int main() {
	Child obj1;
	//obj of class child has all data members and member functions of class parent
	obj1.id_c = 7;
	obj1.id_p = 91;
	return 0;
}

Access Modes:
Public: public member of base class will be public in derived class, protected from base will be protected in derived
Protected: public and protected members of base will be come protected in derived
Private: public and protected from base will be private in derived

class A
{
public:
    int x;
protected:
    int y;
private:
    int z;
};
 
class B : public A
{
    // x is public
    // y is protected
    // z is not accessible from B
};
 
class C : protected A
{
    // x is protected
    // y is protected
    // z is not accessible from C
};
 
class D : private A    // 'private' is default for classes
{
    // x is private
    // y is private
    // z is not accessible from D
};

Single Inheritance in C++:
class is allowed to inherit from only one class
i.e. one sub class is inhereted by one base class only

Multiple Inheritance in C++:
class can inherit from more than one class.
i.e. one sub class can come from multiple base classes

Syntax of Multiple Inheritance:
class SubclassName : AccessMode BaseClass1, AccessMode BaseClass2 ... etc {
	// body of sub class
};

Multilevel Inheritance:
derived class created from another derived class

class BaseClass {...};
class MidClass :  AccessMode BaseClass {...};
class SubSubClass : AccessMode MidClass {...};

Hierarchical Inheritance:
more than one derived class is created from a single base class

Hybrid (Virtual) Inheritance:
combining more than one type of inheritance

Multipath Inheritance: Special case
Derived Class with two base classes which share a same base class
can create ambiguity since bottom class will have two copies of top base class members
class ClassA {
public:
    int a;
};
 
class ClassB : public ClassA {
public:
    int b;
};
class ClassC : public ClassA {
public:
    int c;
};
 
class ClassD : public ClassB, public ClassC {
public:
    int d;
};
 
void main()
{
 
    ClassD obj;
 
    // obj.a = 10;                   //Statement 1, Error
    // obj.a = 100;                 //Statement 2, Error
 
    obj.ClassB::a = 10; // Statement 3
    obj.ClassC::a = 100; // Statement 4
 
    obj.b = 20;
    obj.c = 30;
    obj.d = 40;
 
    cout << "\n A from ClassB  : " << obj.ClassB::a;
    cout << "\n A from ClassC  : " << obj.ClassC::a;
 
    cout << "\n B : " << obj.b;
    cout << "\n C : " << obj.c;
    cout << "\n D : " << obj.d;
}
to avoid ambiguity, path to top base class members should be specified like above
use scope resolution operator '::' to manually specify path

There are still two copies of classA in classD though
	to avoid this, use keyword 'virtual'
class ClassA
     {
            public:
            int a;
     };
 
     class ClassB : virtual public ClassA
     {
            public:
            int b;
     };
     class ClassC : virtual public ClassA
     {
            public:
            int c;
     };
 
     class ClassD : public ClassB, public ClassC
     {
            public:
            int d;
     };
 
     void main()
     {
 
            ClassD obj;
 
            obj.a = 10;        //Statement 3
            obj.a = 100;      //Statement 4
 
            obj.b = 20;
            obj.c = 30;
            obj.d = 40;
 
            cout<< "\n A : "<< obj.a;
            cout<< "\n B : "<< obj.b;
            cout<< "\n C : "<< obj.c;
            cout<< "\n D : "<< obj.d;
 
     }

Polymorphism in C++:
two main types:
	Compile time polymorphism
		Function overloading
		Operator overloading
	Runtime polymorphism
		Virtual functions

class Cars {
	public:
	
	// func with 1 int param
	void func(int x) {
		cout << "Value of x is " << x << endl;
	}

	// func with same name but 1 double param
	voud func(double x) {
		cout << "value of x is " << x << endl;
	
	// func with same name but 2 int params
	void func(int x, int y) {
		cout << "value of x and y is " << x << ", " << y << endl;
	}
};

Operator Overloading:
class Complex {
private:
	int real, imag;
public:
	Complex(int r = 0, int i = 0) {real = r, imag = j;}
	
	//this is automatically called when + is used b/w two complex objects
	Complex operator + (Complex const &obj) {
		Complex res;
		res.real = real + obj.real;
		res.imag = imag + obj.imag;
		return res;
	}
	void print() { cout << real << " + i" << imag << endl; }
};



Runtime polymorphism:
achieved by function overriding
	when a derived class has a def for one of the member functions of the base class
	funcion is said to be overridden

class base {
public:
	virtual void print() // specifying as virtual
		{ cout << "print base class" << endl;}
	void show() // non virtual
		{ cout << "show base class" << endl; }
};
class derived: public base {
public:
	void print() // print is already virtual
	{ cout << "print derived class" << endl; }
	void show() 
	{ cout << "show derived class" << endl; }
};
int main() {
	base *bptr;
	derived d;
	bptr = &d;
	//virtual function binded at runtime (runtime polymorphism)
	bptr->print();
	//non virtual function binded at compile time
	bptr->show();
	return 0;
}
OUTPUTS:
print derived class
print base class

since show() method is not virtual it is binded at compile time while print class is binded at runtime

Encapsulation in C++:
leads to data abstraction or hiding
use of access modifiers

class Encapsulation {
private:
	//data hidden from outside world
	int x;
public:
	//function to set value of var x

	void set(int a)
	{ x = a; }
	//func to return value of var x
	int get() {return x;}
};
int main() {
	Encapsulation obj;
	obj.set(5);
	cout << obj.get();
	return 0;
}

Since function in public access had authority to return private var,
	it is able to be accessed but only through that func

Abstraction in C++:
displaying only essential info

Abstraction using Classes:
	helps us to group data members and member functions using available access specifiers
	class can decide which data members are public or private

Abstraction in Header files:
	consider pow() method in math.h header file
	underlying algorithm is hiddne when pow() is called

For abstraction in Classes, a publicly defined method must be used to access a privately defined variable


Function Overloading in C++:
using namespace std;
void print(int i) {cout<<" Here is int "<<i<<endl;}
void print(double f) {cout<<" Here is float "<<f<<endl;}
void print(char const *c) {cout<<" Here is char* "<<c<<endl;}
int main() {
	print(10);
	print(10.10);
	print("ten");
	return 0;
}

Operator Overloading in C++:
operators that cannot be overloaded:
	.
	::
	?:
	sizeof

Variable Length Arguments for Macros:
use of '...'
also need "__VA_ARGS__" preprocessing identifier

ex:
#define ERR 2
#define INFO 1
#define STD_OUT stdout
#define STR_ERR stderr
#define LOG_MESSAGE(prio, stream, msg, ...) do {\
				char *str;\
				if(prio==INFO)\
					str="INFO";\
				else if (prio==ERR)\
					str = "ERR";\
				fprintf(stream, "[%s] : %s : %d : "msg" \n",\
					str,__FILE__,__LINE__,##__VA_ARGS__);\
			} while (0)


QuickSort:
qsort(), used to sort an array
qsort prototype: void qsort (void* base, size_t num, size_t size, int (*comparator)(const void*, const void*));

in C++:
sort() sorts elements in ascending order
takes 2 params: beginning of array and length of array which we want to be sorted
main(){
int arr[] = {1, 5, 8, 9, 6, 7, 3, 4, 0};
int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
sort(arr, arr + n);
for (int i; i<n; i++)
	cout<<arr[i]<<" ";
return 0;
}

greater() func to sort in descending order:
ex. sort(arr, arr+n, greater<int>());

Custom order:
create your own function to compare:
struct Interval { int start, end; };
bool compareInterval(Interval i1, Interval i2) { return i1.start < i2.start); }
	// any boolean expression can be used. here, if return statement is true, then i1 is before i2
int main () {
	...
	sort(arr, arr+n, compareInterval);

Vector in C++:
Dynamic arrays with the ability to resize automatically
contiguous storage
Iterators:
begin()		iterator pointing at first element
end()		iterator pointing at theoretical element that follows last element
rbegin()	reverse iterator pointed at last element, moves backwards
rend()		reverse iterator pointing to the theoretical element preceding the first element
cbegin()	constant iterator pointing to first element
cend()		constant iterator pointing to theoretical element following last
crbegin()	constant reverse iterator pointing to last element
crend()		constant reverse iterator pointing to theoretical element preceding first

int main() {
	vector<int> g1;
	for (int i = 1; i<=5; i++)
		g1.push_back(i);

Output of begin and end: 1 2 3 4 5 
Output of cbegin and cend: 1 2 3 4 5 
Output of rbegin and rend: 5 4 3 2 1 
Output of crbegin and crend : 5 4 3 2 1

More operations for vectors:
size()		num of elements
max_size()	max number of elements vector can hold
capacity()	size of storage space allocated to vector
resize(n)	resizes the container so it has 'n' elements
empty()		returns whether the container is empty or not
shrink_to_fit()	reduces capacity of container to fit its size destroys elements past its capacity
reserve()	requests that vector capacity can be at least enought to contain n elements

Element access:
reference operator[g]	returns a reference to the element at position 'g' in vector
at(g)			returns a ref to the element at position 'g'
front()			returns a ref to first element
back()			returns ref to last element
data()			returns a direct pointer to the memory array used internally

Modifiers:
assign()	assignes new val to vector elements by replacing old ones
push_back()	push elements into vector from back
pop_back()	pop or remove elements from back of vector
insert()	inserts new elements before element at specified pos
erase()		used to remove element from a specified pos or range
swap()		swap contents of one vector with another of same size. sizes may differ
clear()		used to remove all elements
emplace()	extends the container by instering new element at position
emplace_back()	insert new element into vector at the end

Queues in STL:
containers that operate in first in first out (FIFO) arrangement
elements are inserted from back and deleted from front
Many similar functions to vectors
pop() 		deletes first element
push(g)		adds 'g' to back
emplace()	inserts a new element in queue container to end
swap()		exchange contents of two queues of same type, may differ in size
empty()		returns whether queue is empty or not
front()		returns ref to first element
back()		returns ref to last element

Priority Queue in C++ STL:
first element of queue is greatest of all elements in queue
Automatically orders elements in descending order
priority_queue<int> gquiz;
gquiz.push(10);

Reverse order: priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> gquiz;
		gquiz.push(10);

Double Ended Queues (deques)
sequence containers can can expand and contract at both ends
similar to vectors but more efficient in cases of inserion and deletion of elements
same functions as vectors but with: 
	push_front() and pop_front()
which allow them to be modified in both directions
SYNTAX:
deque<int> gquiz;
gquiz.push_back(10);
gquiz.push_front(20);
gquiz.push_back(30);
qguiz.push_front(15);



File Handling through C++ Classes:
files are dealt through: fstream, ifstream, ofstream available in fstream header file

ofstream: 	stream class to write on files
ifstream:	stream class to read from files
fstream:	stream class to both read and write from/to files

open file by using constructor:
ifstream (const char* filename,ios_base::openmode mode=ios_base::in);
ifstream fin(filename, openmode) by default openmode = ios::in
ifstream fin("filename");

open file by using open method:
calling default constructor
ifstream fin;
fin.open(filename, openmode)
fin.open("filename");

Open Modes:
in*	input	file open for reading: the internal stream buffer supports input operations
out	output	file open for writing: the internal stream buffer supports output operations
binary	binary	operators are performed in binary rather than text
ate	at end	the output position starts at the end of he file
app	append	all output operations happen at the end of the file, appending to its existing contents
trunc	truncate	any contents that existed in the file before its open are discarded

default open modes:
ifstream	ios::in
ofstream	ios::out
fstream		ios::in | ios::out

IFSTREAM AND OFSTREAM CLASSES:
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
	ofstream fout;
	string line;
	fout.open("sample.txt");
	//ios::out automatically deletes content of file. to append, write
	//fout.open("sample.txt", ios::app);

	while (fout){
		// read a line from standard input
		getline(cin,line);
		//press -1 to exit
		if (line=="-1")
			break;
		//write line in file
		fout<<line<<endl;
	}
	fout.close();
	//creation of ifstream class object to read file
	ifstream fin;
	//by default open mode = ios::in mode
	fin.open("sample.txt");
	//execute a lop until EOF
	while (fin) {
		//read a line from file
		getline(fin, line);
		//print line in console
		cout << line << endl;
	}
	fin.close();
	return 0;
}
	
just FSTREAM class:
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	//creation of fstream class obj
	fstream fio;
	string line;
	//ios::in and ios::out by deafult, so it deletes previous file
	//use fio.open("sample.txt", ios:in|ios:out|ios::app); to append to file
	fio.open("sample.txt, ios:truc|ios:out|ios::in); 
	//execute a loop if opened
	while (fio){
		//read a line from standard input
		getline(cin, line);
		//press "-1" to exit
		if (line=="-1")
			break;
		fio<<line<<endl;
	}
	//execute a loop until EOF
	fio.seekg(0, ios::beg);
	while (fio) {
		getline(fio, line);
		cout << line << endl;
	}
	fio.close();
	return 0;
}

Read/write class objects from/to file in C++:
to write objects data members in a file:
//file_obj is an object of ofstream
file_obj.write((char *) & class_obj, sizeof(class_obj));

to read files data member into an object:
//file_obj is an object of ifstream
file_obj.read((char *) & class_obj, sizeof(class_obj));

#include <iostream>
#includefstream
using namespacestd;
class Contestant{
public:
	string Name;
	int Age, Ratings;
	int input();
	int output_highest_rated();
};

int Contestant::input() {
	ofstream file_obj; //make file_obj of ofstream class
	file_obj.open("Input.txt", ios::app);
	Contestant obj; //make obj of Contestant class
	string str = "Michael";
	int age = 18, ratings = 2500
	obj.Name = str;
	obj.Age = age;
	obj.Ratings = ratings;
	//writing objects data to file
	file_obj.write((char*)&obj,sizeof(obj));
	
	str = "Terry";
	age = 21;
	ratings = 3200;
	obj.Name = str;
	obj.Age = age;
	obj.Ratings = ratings;

	int max = 0;
	string Highest_rated;
	while (!file.obj.eof()) {
		if(obj.Ratings > max) {
			max = obj.Ratings
			Highest_rated = obj.Name;
		}
		file_obj.read((char*)&obj,sizeof(obj));
	}
	cout << Highest_rated;
	return 0;
}
int main() {
	Contestant object;
	object.input();
	object.output_highest_rated();
	return 0;
}


C++ Program to create a file:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	fstream file;
	file.open("gfg.txt", ios::out);
	if(!file) {
		cout<<"Error in creating file!!!";
		return 0;
	}
	cout<<"File created successfully";
	file.close;
	return 0;
}

CSV file management using C++:
data fields are deliminated by ,
rows are separated by newline

create operation:

	fstream fout;	
	fout.open("reportcard.csv",ios::out | ios::app);
	cout<<"Enter the details of 5 studetns:"<<" roll name maths phys chem bio";
	<<endl;
	int i, roll, phy, chem, math, bio;
	string name;

	for (i=0; i<5; i++) {

	if (count == 0)
		cout<< "Record not found\n");
}
		
Update a record:
void update_recode()
{
  
    // File pointer

#include<stdbool.h>

//Function to get file size:
unsigned long long int fileSize(const char *filename)

//Function to tell if file exists or not
bool fileExists(const char * fname)
{
	FILE *file;
	if (file=fopen(fname), 'r'))
